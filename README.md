## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The challenges that I came across was part of the submission process because it involved using git and I'm fairly new to git.
I'm glad the tech fellows were there to assist us with it.  It saved me a lot of time that I would've spent on my own just researching
how to do it.  Another challenge was using xcode and swift for the first time.  The steps were very easy to follow which helped me have a 
successful app when I ran it.
